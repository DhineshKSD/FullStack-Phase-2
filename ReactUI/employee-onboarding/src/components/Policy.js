                <b>1. Definition of Confidential Information.</b><br/>
                I understand that “Company Confidential Information” means information (including any and all combinations of individual items of information) that the Company has or will develop, acquire, create, compile, 
                discover or own, that has value in or to the Company’s business which is not generally known and which the Company wishes to maintain as confidential. Company Confidential Information includes both information 
                disclosed by the Company to me, and information developed or learned by me during the course of my employment with Company. Company Confidential Information also includes all information of which the unauthorized
                disclosure could be detrimental to the interests of Company, whether or not such information is identified as Company Confidential Information. By example, and without limitation, Company Confidential Information 
                includes any and all non-public information that relates to the actual or anticipated business and/or products, research or development of the Company, or to the Company’s technical data, trade secrets, or know-how, 
                including, but not limited to, research, product plans, or other information regarding the Company’s products or services and markets therefor, customer lists and customers (including, but not limited to, customers 
                of the Company on which I called or with which I may become acquainted during the term of my employment), software, developments, inventions, discoveries, ideas, processes, formulas, technology, designs, drawings, 
                engineering, hardware configuration information, marketing, finances, and other business information disclosed by the Company either directly or indirectly in writing, orally or by drawings or inspection of premises, 
                parts, equipment, or other Company property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company Confidential Information shall not include any such information which I can establish (i) was publicly known or made generally available 
                prior to the time of disclosure by Company to me; (ii) becomes publicly known or made generally available after disclosure by Company to me through no wrongful action or omission by me; or (iii) is in my rightful possession, 
                without confidentiality obligations, at the time of disclosure by Company as shown by my then-contemporaneous written records; provided that any combination of individual items of information shall not be deemed to be 
                within any of the foregoing exceptions merely because one or more of the individual items are within such exception, unless the combination as a whole is within such exception. I understand that nothing in this Agreement 
                is intended to limit employees’ rights to discuss the terms, wages, and working conditions of their employment, as protected by applicable law.

                <b>2.Nonuse and Nondisclosure.</b><br/>
                At all times, both during and after my Employment/Association with the Company: (a) I will hold Confidential Information in confidence; (b) I undertake not to use, transfer, publish, disclose or report Confidential Information 
                directly or indirectly, except such disclosure to other Company employees or authorized third parties as may be necessary in the ordinary course of performing my duties for the Company or otherwise as directed by the Company; 
                and (c) I undertake not to use Confidential Information in order to further my own interests or the interests of any entity other than the Company.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>3.Former Employer Confidential Information.</b><br/>
                I agree that during my employment with the Company, I will not improperly use, disclose, or induce the Company to use any proprietary information or trade secrets of any former employer or other person or entity with which I have 
                an obligation to keep in confidence. I further agree that I will not bring onto the Company’s premises or transfer onto the Company’s technology systems any unpublished document, proprietary information, or trade secrets belonging 
                to any such third party unless disclosure to, and use by, the Company has been consented to in writing by such third party
                <br/><br/>
                <b>4.Assignment of Inventions.</b><br/> 
                I will promptly disclose to the Company all Confidential Information conceived by me alone or with others during the term of my Employment/Association, whether or not conceived during regular business hours. I further agree that:
                All such Confidential Information shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company.
                I shall execute without receiving additional compensation (a) any formal documents necessary to assign any Intellectual Property to the Company, and (c) all documents required to obtain a patent, register a copyright, or enforce 
                the Company's rights in such Intellectual Property.These obligations shall continue beyond the termination of Employment/Association with respect to Intellectual Property that I conceive or make during the period of my Employment/Association.

                <b>5.Termination Clause:</b><br/>
                I acknowledge that the Company’s business is global in nature, in that it provides products to customers throughout the world and/or has the capability to do so. I also acknowledge that the industries in which the Company operates are highly competitive, 
                and that there is a relatively small market of Customers for the Company’s products and services. As a result, I acknowledge that the Company has a strong interest in protecting its relationships with its Customers and its position in its markets, and that
                the restrictions on my future employment set forth below are fair and reasonable.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>5.1.</b> During my Employment/Association with the Company and for a period of two (2) years after my Employment/Association with the Company terminates, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, I will not on my own behalf or on behalf of any other person or entity, directly or indirectly:
